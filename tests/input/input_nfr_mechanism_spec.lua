-- Availability: predates the Compy input API (introduced in
-- 1.0.0-rc20260712).

-- NFR and mechanism guards. Routing invariant
-- (doc/development/decisions/input.md, D-ROUTE-OWNS):
-- inter-route dispatch is EXCLUSIVE — each event reaches
-- exactly ONE route, fixed by the active screen mode.
-- Vocabulary (doc/development/internals/user_input.md,
-- "Dispatch chain"): ROUTE = the controller an event is
-- dispatched to; WIDGET = the route-managed input surface and
-- terminal of the chain. Tests assert observable outcomes at
-- public seams, never method-name spies. keypressed fires for
-- every physical key, textinput only for character-producing
-- keys (doc/development/internals/user_input.md, "Data flow").

-- Guards on MECHANISM, not on behaviour: object identity and
-- allocation. Nothing here
-- is a project-facing contract — those live in the other
-- input_*_spec.lua files, and a case that turns out to be one
-- belongs there instead.
--
-- The file has been narrowed twice on that test. A wheel case
-- went to input_events_spec.lua when it became one case of
-- "every channel reaches the route"; a characterisation case
-- went entirely, having stopped discriminating.
